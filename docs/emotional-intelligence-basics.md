# ðŸ§  Emotional Intelligence (EI) for AI-Driven Chatbots

## What is Emotional Intelligence?
Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as recognize, understand, and influence the emotions of others.

### 5 Core Components:
1. **Self-Awareness** â€“ Understanding your own emotions.
2. **Self-Regulation** â€“ Managing emotions in healthy ways.
3. **Motivation** â€“ Using emotions to pursue goals.
4. **Empathy** â€“ Understanding the emotions of others.
5. **Social Skills** â€“ Managing relationships effectively.

## Why It Matters for Chatbots
Chatbots that incorporate EI can:
- Build trust and connection
- Offer more relevant support
- Reduce user frustration
- Encourage continued use

## Example in Therabot:
- Instead of: "Thatâ€™s unfortunate."
- Say: "Iâ€™m really sorry youâ€™re feeling this way. Youâ€™re not alone."
